### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I mainly worked on getting my ViewModel figured out. I chose to focus on this area because understanding the ViewModel and how 
it interacts with networking and the view is important to me.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
5 hours

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I initially focused on getting everything working. However, I soon realized I needed to separate my networking and establish 
protocols to integrate into my ViewModel. This did take a little more time, but implementing this made my networking and testing much cleaner.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
My initial view was not very polished, but I think I did get a good start on it.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I am very excited about this opportunity to work with Fetch.
